We can help you plan and execute the migrating, connecting and provisioning identity from your private servers to the cloud.  Identity enables your services to connect securely regardless of where they are hosted.  It's critical to have a solid understanding of how provisioning identities into different cloud providers impacts your ability to use services provided by those cloud providers as well as any additional security exposure being in the cloud introduces to your organization.
